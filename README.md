Alpine Linux is a lightweigh distribution that uses OpenRC.
By using Alpine you can cut the crap, save resources and isolate more applications with less overhead.
Here I am creating some sample scripts that I use within my own lab to get apps such as prometheus, grafana and GreyLOG working inside of docker containers using alpine.
Currently configured for 86_64 Extended 3.19.1
